/**
 * <p>
 * This MockUp class provides the system we're using some convenient methods to
 * access actors. It oversteps our temporary weak comprehension of the akka
 * framework by avoiding using ActorPath. Thus it comes with severe limitations:
 * we can't scale it on multiple JVMs and it may include some drawbacks.
 * However, the single JVM flaw had widely spread through this project: we never
 * use ActorPath.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Either real `ActorSystem system` object should be use instead, or this class
 * should only be an stateless proxy to `system` which merely reformulates
 * access to it. The class Interpretor is designed to implement this interface
 * in such a way.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Despite of all these flaws, it's quite convenient as it provides a handy,
 * short way to access the system. Moreover, as it's believed to be used often,
 * we use concurrent data structure.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When you get yourself free from this class, don't forget to search for use or
 * track @Deprecated warnings.
 * </p>
